While people can fluidly collect, make sense of  and organize information
across many online sources in their minds to make informed decisions, the
amount of online information can be overwhelming and exceed people's working
memory.  We introduce Fuse, a browser extension that combined low-cost
collection with lightweight organization of web content in a compact card-based
sidebar.  Fuse helps users simultaneously extract key web content and structure
it in a lightweight and visual way.  A 22-month public deployment and
interviews provide longitudinal insights into the collecting, externalization
and  structuring behaviors of real-world users conducting information foraging
tasks.

Abstract
----------------------
People spend a significant amount of time trying to make sense of the internet,
collecting content from a variety of sources and organizing it to make
decisions and achieve their goals. While humans are able to fluidly iterate on
collecting and organizing information in their minds, existing tools and
approaches introduce significant friction into the process. We introduce Fuse,
a browser extension that externalizes users' working memory by combining
low-cost collection with lightweight organization of content in a compact
card-based sidebar that is always available. Fuse helps users simultaneously
extract key web content and structure it in a lightweight and visual way. We
discuss how these affordances help users externalize more of their mental model
into the system (e.g., saving, annotating, and structuring items) and support
fast reviewing and resumption of task contexts. Our 22-month public deployment
and follow-up interviews provide longitudinal insights into the structuring
behaviors of real-world users conducting information foraging tasks.
