Crowd-powered chatbots are robust than current pure AI approach, but can be
slower and more expensive at runtime. We attempted to combine the two
approaches for high quality, low latency, and low cost.  We introduce Evorus, a
crowd-powered chatbot that automate itself over time by learning to integrate
AI chatbots, reusing responses, and assess response quality. A 5-month-long
public deployment study shows promising results. You can [start using Evorus today](http://talkingtothecrowd.org/).

Abstract
----------------------
Crowd-powered conversational assistants have been shown to be more robust than
automated systems, but do so at the cost of higher response latency and
monetary costs.  A promising direction is to combine the two approaches for
high quality, low latency, and low cost solutions.  In this paper, we introduce
Evorus, a crowd-powered conversational assistant built to automate itself over
time by i) allowing new chatbots to be easily integrated to automate more
scenarios, ii) reusing prior crowd answers, and iii) learning to automatically
approve response candidates.  Our 5-month-long deployment with 80 participants
and 281 conversations shows that Evorus can automate itself without
compromising conversation quality.  Crowd-AI architectures have long been
proposed as a way to reduce cost and latency for crowd-powered systems; Evorus
demonstrates how automation can be introduced successfully in a deployed
system. Its architecture allows future researchers to make further innovation
on the underlying automated components in the context of a deployed open domain
dialog system.
