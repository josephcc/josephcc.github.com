Alloy is a crowd clustering pipeline that combines the deep semantic knowledge
from human computation and the scalability of machine learning models to create
rich structures from unorganized documents with high quality and efficiency.

Abstract
----------------------
Crowdsourced clustering approaches present a promising way to harness deep
semantic knowledge for clustering complex information. However, existing
approaches have difficulties supporting the global context needed for workers
to generate meaningful categories, and are costly because all items require
human judgments. We introduce Alloy, a hybrid approach that combines the
richness of human judgments with the power of machine algorithms. Alloy
supports greater global context through a new *sample and search*
crowd pattern which changes the crowd's task from classifying a fixed subset of
items to actively sampling and querying the entire dataset.  It also improves
efficiency through a two phase process in which crowds provide examples to help
a machine cluster the head of the distribution, then classify low-confidence
examples in the tail. To accomplish this, Alloy introduces a modular
*cast and gather* approach which leverages a machine learning backbone
to stitch together different types of judgment tasks.
