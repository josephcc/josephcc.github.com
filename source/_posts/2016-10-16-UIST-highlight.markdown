We introduce the idea of intentionally uncertain input in the context of
highlighting. We introduced a system that uses force touch and fuzzy
bounding boxes to support saving information while users are uncertain about
where to highlight.

Abstract
----------------------
Patients researching medical diagnoses, scientist exploring new fields of
literature, and students learning about new domains are all faced with the
challenge of capturing information they find for later use. However, saving
information is challenging on mobile devices, where the small screen and font
sizes combined with the inaccuracy of finger based touch screens makes it time
consuming and stressful for people to select and save text for future use.
Furthermore, beyond the challenge of simply selecting a region of bounded text
on a mobile device, in many learning and data exploration tasks the boundaries
of what text may be relevant and useful later are themselves uncertain for the
user. In contrast to previous approaches which focused on speeding up the
selection process by making the identification of hard boundaries faster, we
introduce the idea of intentionally supporting uncertain input in the context
of saving information during complex reading and information exploration. We
embody this idea in a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes
along with posthoc expandable context to support identifying and saving
information in an intentionally uncertain way on mobile devices. In a two part
user study we find that this approach reduced selection time and was preferred
by participants over the default system text selection method.
