Analogies in distant domain often lead to scientitic discoveries. However, it
can be prohibitively difficult for researchers to find useful analogies from
unfamiliar domains as it is poorly supported by search engines. We introduce
Solvent, a mixed-initiative system where annotators structure abstracts of
acedemic papers into different aspects and use a semantic model to find
analogies among research papers and across different domains. These results
demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in
research communities.

Abstract
----------------------

Scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant
domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant
ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. To
provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we
introduce Solvent, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of
research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being
addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how
they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a
computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations
that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. We demonstrate
that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval
approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and
that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. These results
demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in
research communities.
