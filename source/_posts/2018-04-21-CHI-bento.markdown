Complex searches can be overwhelming leading to lots
of tabs.  This also makes conducting searches on mobile devices especially
difficult where screen real-estate is limited and tasks can often be 
inturrupted.  Rather than using tabs to manage information, we introduce
browsing through scaffolding. Search result lists serve as mutable
workspaces where progress can be suspended and resumed.

Abstract
----------------------

People engaged in complex searches such as planning a vacation or understanding
their medical symptoms are often overwhelmed by opening and managing many tabs.
These challenges are exacerbated as search moves to smartphones and mobile
devices where screen real-estate is limited and tasks are frequently suspended,
resumed, and interleaved. Rather than continue to utilize tab-based browsing
for complex search, we introduce a new way of browsing through a scaffolded
interface. The list of search results serves as a mutable workspace, where a
user can track progress on a specific information query. The search query
serves as a gateway into this workspace, accessed through a task-subtask
hierarchy. We instantiate this in the Bento mobile search system and
investigate its effectiveness in three studies. We find converging evidence
that users were able to make progress on their complex searching tasks with
this structure, and find it more organized and easier to revisit.
