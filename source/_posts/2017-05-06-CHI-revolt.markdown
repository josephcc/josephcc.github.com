Generating comprehensive labeling guidelines for crowdworkers can be
chellenging for complex datasets.  Revolt harnesses crowdworker disagreements
to identify ambiguous concepts in the data and coordinates the crowd to
collaboratively create rich structures for requesters to make post-hoc
decisions, removing the need for comprehensive guidelines and
enabling dynamic label boundaries.
