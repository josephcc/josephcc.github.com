The nature of people’s online activities has gone through dramatic changes in
past decades, yet browser interfaces have stayed largely the same since tabs
were introduced nearly 20 years ago. The divide between browser interfaces that
only provide affordances for managing individual tabs and users who manage
their attention at the task level can lead to an "tab overload" problem. We
explored a task-centric tab manager called which enables users to save their
open tabs to manage them with task structures and affordances that better
reflect their mental models. To lower the cost of importing, Tabs.do uses a
neural network in the browser to make suggestions for grouping users' open tabs
by tasks.

Abstract
----------------------
The nature of people’s online activities has gone through dramatic changes in
past decades as significant portions of our productivity and sensemaking tasks
continue to migrate to “the cloud,” yet browser interfaces have stayed
largely the same since tabs were introduced nearly 20 years ago. The divide
between browser interfaces that only provide affordances for managing
individual tabs and users who manage their attention at the task level can lead
to serious adverse effects -- commonly referred to as “tab overload.” This
paper explores the design of a task-centric tab manager called Tabs.do, which
enables users to import and close their open tabs to manage them as tasks.
Users can structure and prioritize their tasks to better reflect their mental
models and resume progress by reopening tasks into open tabs. To lower the cost
of importing, Tabs.do uses machine learning to make intelligent suggestions for
grouping users’ open tabs into task bundles with high precision by exploiting
behavioral and semantic features. Tabs.do bridges the gap between current
browser designs that treat tabs as stacks of independent webpages and users who
manage their workflow and attention at the tasks level. We conducted a field
deployment study where participants used Tabs.do with their real-life tasks and
tabs in the wild and uncovered insights around the costs, benefits, and
limitations of a task-centric approach to tab management.
