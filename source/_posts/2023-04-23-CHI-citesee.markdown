 CiteSee provides a personalized paper reading experience by visually
 augmenting inline citations based on their connections to the current user
 based on their reading history, paper library, and publication records.
 During literature review sessions, CiteSee allows users to prioritize their
 exploration to focus first on inline citations most relevant to their recent
 readings. It also highlights inline citations to familiar papers, allowing
 users to keep track of their exploration and better contexturalize the current
 paper. Lab and field studies showed CiteSee can improve better paper discovery
 via inline citations, and allowed participants to have better situational
 awareness when conducting real-world literature reviews.

Abstract
----------------------

When reading a scholarly article, inline citations help researchers
contextualize the current article and discover relevant prior work. However, it
can be challenging to prioritize and make sense of the hundreds of citations
encountered during literature reviews. This paper introduces CiteSee, a paper
reading tool that leverages a user's publishing, reading, and saving activities
to provide personalized visual augmentations and context around citations.
First, CiteSee connects the current paper to familiar contexts by surfacing
known citations a user had cited or opened. Second, CiteSee helps users
prioritize their exploration by highlighting relevant but unknown citations
based on saving and reading history. We conducted a lab study that suggests
CiteSee is significantly more effective for paper discovery than three
baselines. A field deployment study shows CiteSee helps participants keep
track of their explorations and leads to better situational awareness and
increased paper discovery via inline citation when conducting real-world
literature reviews.
