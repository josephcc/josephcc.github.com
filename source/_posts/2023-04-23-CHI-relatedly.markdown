Scientific breakthroughs often rely upon scholars synthesizing many published
work into broad overviews and rich insights to identify gaps in the current
literature.  However, survey articles require significant time and effort to
synthesize and can quickly become outdated. Researchers in fast-paced
disciplines also rely on the related work section to better understand the
background when reading a paper.  While related work sections also summarizes
multiple prior work, they typically provide partial views of the larger
research domain. Relatedly explore how a system in which users can quickly
explore and read related work sections extracted across many papers can help
scholars gain richer and more comprehensive overviews of fast-paced domains.

Abstract
----------------------

Scholars who want to research a scientific topic must take time to read,
extract meaning, and identify connections across many papers. As scientific
literature grows, this becomes increasingly challenging. Meanwhile, authors
summarize prior research in papers' related work sections, though this is
scoped to support a single paper. A formative study found that while reading
multiple related work paragraphs helps overview a topic, it is hard to navigate
overlapping and diverging references and research foci.  In this work, we
design a system, Relatedly, that scaffolds exploring and reading multiple
related work paragraphs on a topic, with features including dynamic re-ranking
and highlighting to spotlight unexplored dissimilar information, auto-generated
descriptive paragraph headings, and low-lighting of redundant information. From
a within-subjects user study (n=15), we found that scholars generate more
coherent, insightful, and comprehensive topic outlines using Relatedly compared
to a baseline paper list.
