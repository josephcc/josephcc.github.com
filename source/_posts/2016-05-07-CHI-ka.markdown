People often search to web to find solutions to problems beyond factual
question, such as planning road trips, writing an report, or buying a new
camera.  The Knowledge Accelerator uses crowdworkers to synthesize different
information sources on the web in response to a query. We prototyped this
system in order to explore crowdsourcing complex, high context tasks in a
microtask environment.

Abstract
----------------------
Crowdsourcing  offers  a  powerful  new  paradigm  for  onlinework.   However,
real  world  tasks  are  often  interdependent,requiring a big picture view of
the difference pieces involved. Existing  crowdsourcing  approaches  that
support  such  tasks -- ranging from Wikipedia to flash teams -- are
bottleneckedby relying on a small number of individuals to maintain thebig
picture.   In this paper,  we explore the idea that a computational system can
scaffold an emerging interdependent,big picture view entirely through the small
contributions ofindividuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole.
Toinvestigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we
instantiate the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing  distributed
information  synthesis  and  evaluateits output across a variety of topics.  We
also contribute a setof design patterns that may be informative for other
systemsaimed at supporting big picture thinking in small pieces.
