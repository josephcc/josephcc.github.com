***<i class="fa fa-trophy" aria-hidden="true"></i> BEST PAPER NOMINATION***
<br/>

Tabs have become integral to Web browsing yet have changed little since their
introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone through
dramatic changes and increasingly used to support complex sensemaking tasks.
This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a diverse set of
functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We uncovered
competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open (ranging from interaction to
emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them (such as limited attention and
resources). We further developed rich design implications for future browser
interfaces.

Abstract
----------------------
Tabs have become integral to browsing the Web yet have changed little since
their introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone
through dramatic changes, with users increasingly moving from navigating to
websites to exploring information across many sources to support online
sensemaking. This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a
diverse set of functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We
interviewed ten information workers asking about their tab management
strategies and walk through each open tab on their work computers four times
over two weeks. We uncovered competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open
(ranging from interaction to emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them
(such as limited attention and resources). We then surveyed 103 participants to
estimate the frequencies of these pressures at scale. Finally, we developed
design implications for future browser interfaces that can better support
managing these pressures
