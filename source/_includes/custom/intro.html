      <p>
        I am a PhD Student at the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon
        University. I specialize in Human-Computer Interaction, Natural Language Processing, and
        Sensemaking.

        I study how people explore, structure, and make sense of new
        information in complex decision-making scenarios such as exploratory
        search and data analytics. The insights help me explore new ways of using
        crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning
        approaches to build novel interactive intelligent information
        systems that augment human cognition to enhance learning, knowledge
        production, and scientific discovery.
