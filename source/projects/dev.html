                0xBench is an open source Android app and website I developed using Java and C for 0xlab
                Inc. during my four-month part-time internship. It is designed to be an open platform
                for benchmarking Android on a system level. 0xBench is now being used by major companies
                worldwide, and it even ships with Texas Instrument's devboards.
