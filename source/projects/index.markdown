_0xBench_ is an open source Android app and website I developed using Java and C for _0xlab Inc._ during
my four-month part-time internship. It is designed to be an open platform for benchmarking Android on a
system level. _0xBench_ is now beening used by major companies worldwide, and it even ships with _Taxus
Instrument_'s devboards.

### KerKerInput (Android IME)
One of the first Chinese input methods implemented for the Android platform. My main contribution is
improving precision on choice-of-character on phonics-based input methods and implementing
next-word-prediction using probability distribution and language model.

School Projects
---------------
Projects I wrote for school courses or publications.

### Head-Tracking for Virtual Reality (OpenCV)

I made a infrared filter out of different cellophanes for my webcam, and mounted two infrared
LEDs on a hat. Using OpenCV to track the position and distance between the two LEDs, the user's 3D
location can be calculated to simulate virtual reality (first video) or gaming (second video).
