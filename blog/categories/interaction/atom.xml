<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Reviewing the literature to understand relevant threads of past work is a
critical part of research and vehicle for learning. However, as the scientific
literature grows the challenges for users to find and make sense of the many
different threads of research grow as well. Previous work has helped scholars
to find and group papers with citation information or textual similarity using
standalone tools or overview visualizations. Instead, in this work we explore a
tool integrated into users' reading process that helps them with leveraging
authors' existing summarization of threads, typically in introduction or
related work sections, in order to situate their own work's contributions. To
explore this we developed a prototype that supports efficient extraction and
organization of threads along with supporting evidence as scientists read
research articles. The system then recommends further relevant articles based
on user-created threads. We evaluate the system in a lab study and find that it
helps scientists to follow and curate research threads without breaking out of
their flow of reading, collect relevant papers and clips, and discover
interesting new articles to further grow threads.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>People spend a significant amount of time trying to make sense of the internet,
collecting content from a variety of sources and organizing it to make
decisions and achieve their goals. While humans are able to fluidly iterate on
collecting and organizing information in their minds, existing tools and
approaches introduce significant friction into the process. We introduce Fuse,
a browser extension that externalizes users' working memory by combining
low-cost collection with lightweight organization of content in a compact
card-based sidebar that is always available. Fuse helps users simultaneously
extract key web content and structure it in a lightweight and visual way. We
discuss how these affordances help users externalize more of their mental model
into the system (e.g., saving, annotating, and structuring items) and support
fast reviewing and resumption of task contexts. Our 22-month public deployment
and follow-up interviews provide longitudinal insights into the structuring
behaviors of real-world users conducting information foraging tasks.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Consumers conducting comparison shopping, researchers making sense of
competitive space, and developers looking for code snippets online all face the
challenge of capturing the information they find for later use without
interrupting their current flow. In addition, during many learning and
exploration tasks, people need to externalize their mental context, such as
estimating how urgent a topic is to follow up on, or rating a piece of evidence
as a "pro" or "con," which helps scaffold subsequent deeper exploration.
However, current approaches incur a high cost, often requiring users to select,
copy, context switch, paste, and annotate information in a separate document
without offering specific affordances that capture their mental context. In
this work, we explore a new interaction technique called "wiggling," which can
be used to fluidly collect, organize, and rate information during early
sensemaking stages with a single gesture. Wiggling involves rapid
back-and-forth movements of a pointer or up-and-down scrolling on a smartphone,
which can indicate the information to be collected and its valence, using a
single, light-weight gesture that does not interfere with other interactions
that are already available. Through implementation and user evaluation, we
found that wiggling helped participants accurately collect information and
encode their mental context with a 58% reduction in operational cost while
being 24% faster compared to a common baseline.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The nature of people’s online activities has gone through dramatic changes in
past decades as significant portions of our productivity and sensemaking tasks
continue to migrate to “the cloud,” yet browser interfaces have stayed
largely the same since tabs were introduced nearly 20 years ago. The divide
between browser interfaces that only provide affordances for managing
individual tabs and users who manage their attention at the task level can lead
to serious adverse effects -- commonly referred to as “tab overload.” This
paper explores the design of a task-centric tab manager called Tabs.do, which
enables users to import and close their open tabs to manage them as tasks.
Users can structure and prioritize their tasks to better reflect their mental
models and resume progress by reopening tasks into open tabs. To lower the cost
of importing, Tabs.do uses machine learning to make intelligent suggestions for
grouping users’ open tabs into task bundles with high precision by exploiting
behavioral and semantic features. Tabs.do bridges the gap between current
browser designs that treat tabs as stacks of independent webpages and users who
manage their workflow and attention at the tasks level. We conducted a field
deployment study where participants used Tabs.do with their real-life tasks and
tabs in the wild and uncovered insights around the costs, benefits, and
limitations of a task-centric approach to tab management.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Tabs have become integral to browsing the Web yet have changed little since
their introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone
through dramatic changes, with users increasingly moving from navigating to
websites to exploring information across many sources to support online
sensemaking. This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a
diverse set of functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We
interviewed ten information workers asking about their tab management
strategies and walk through each open tab on their work computers four times
over two weeks. We uncovered competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open
(ranging from interaction to emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them
(such as limited attention and resources). We then surveyed 103 participants to
estimate the frequencies of these pressures at scale. Finally, we developed
design implications for future browser interfaces that can better support
managing these pressures</p>
