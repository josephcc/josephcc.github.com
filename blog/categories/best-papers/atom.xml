<p>Tabs have become integral to Web browsing yet have changed little since their
introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone through
dramatic changes and increasingly used to support complex sensemaking tasks.
This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a diverse set of
functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We uncovered
competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open (ranging from interaction to
emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them (such as limited attention and
resources). We further developed rich design implications for future browser
interfaces.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Tabs have become integral to browsing the Web yet have changed little since
their introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone
through dramatic changes, with users increasingly moving from navigating to
websites to exploring information across many sources to support online
sensemaking. This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a
diverse set of functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We
interviewed ten information workers asking about their tab management
strategies and walk through each open tab on their work computers four times
over two weeks. We uncovered competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open
(ranging from interaction to emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them
(such as limited attention and resources). We then surveyed 103 participants to
estimate the frequencies of these pressures at scale. Finally, we developed
design implications for future browser interfaces that can better support
managing these pressures</p>

Crowd-powered chatbots are robust than current pure AI approach, but can be
slower and more expensive at runtime. We attempted to combine the two
approaches for high quality, low latency, and low cost.  We introduce Evorus, a
crowd-powered chatbot that automate itself over time by learning to integrate
AI chatbots, reusing responses, and assess response quality. A 5-month-long
public deployment study shows promising results. You can <a href="http://talkingtothecrowd.org/">try talking to Evorus today</a>.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Crowd-powered conversational assistants have been shown to be more robust than
automated systems, but do so at the cost of higher response latency and
monetary costs.  A promising direction is to combine the two approaches for
high quality, low latency, and low cost solutions.  In this paper, we introduce
Evorus, a crowd-powered conversational assistant built to automate itself over
time by i) allowing new chatbots to be easily integrated to automate more
scenarios, ii) reusing prior crowd answers, and iii) learning to automatically
approve response candidates.  Our 5-month-long deployment with 80 participants
and 281 conversations shows that Evorus can automate itself without
compromising conversation quality.  Crowd-AI architectures have long been
proposed as a way to reduce cost and latency for crowd-powered systems; Evorus
demonstrates how automation can be introduced successfully in a deployed
system. Its architecture allows future researchers to make further innovation
on the underlying automated components in the context of a deployed open domain
dialog system.</p>

Many crowd clustering approaches have difficulties providing global context to
workers in order to generate meaningful categories. Alloy uses a
<em>sample-and-search</em> technique to provide a better understanding of the global
context. It also combines the in-depth semantic knowledge from human
computation and the scalability of machine learning models to create rich
structures from unorganized documents with high quality and efficiency.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Crowdsourced clustering approaches present a promising way to harness deep
semantic knowledge for clustering complex information. However, existing
approaches have difficulties supporting the global context needed for workers
to generate meaningful categories, and are costly because all items require
human judgments. We introduce Alloy, a hybrid approach that combines the
richness of human judgments with the power of machine algorithms. Alloy
supports greater global context through a new <em>sample and search</em>
crowd pattern which changes the crowd's task from classifying a fixed subset of
items to actively sampling and querying the entire dataset.  It also improves
efficiency through a two phase process in which crowds provide examples to help
a machine cluster the head of the distribution, then classify low-confidence
examples in the tail. To accomplish this, Alloy introduces a modular
<em>cast and gather</em> approach which leverages a machine learning backbone
to stitch together different types of judgment tasks.</p>

Answering complex questions such as "How do I grow better tomatoes?" often
requires individuals to conduct extensive online research and synthesis. Can we
crowdsource this complex, high context process with 100 crowdworkers conducting
microtasks distributedly? The Knowledge Accelerator uses crowdworkers to
extract and synthesize text clips across web pages into coherent articles
without a centralized coordinator.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Crowdsourcing  offers  a  powerful  new  paradigm  for  onlinework.   However,
real  world  tasks  are  often  interdependent,requiring a big picture view of
the difference pieces involved. Existing  crowdsourcing  approaches  that
support  such  tasks -- ranging from Wikipedia to flash teams -- are
bottleneckedby relying on a small number of individuals to maintain thebig
picture.   In this paper,  we explore the idea that a computational system can
scaffold an emerging interdependent,big picture view entirely through the small
contributions ofindividuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole.
Toinvestigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we
instantiate the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing  distributed
information  synthesis  and  evaluateits output across a variety of topics.  We
also contribute a setof design patterns that may be informative for other
systemsaimed at supporting big picture thinking in small pieces.</p>
