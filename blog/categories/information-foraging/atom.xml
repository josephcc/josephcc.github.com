much information they needed to include.  We introduce the idea of
intentionally uncertain input in the context of highlighting on mobile devices.
We present a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes to support
saving information while users are uncertain about where to highlight.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Patients researching medical diagnoses, scientist exploring new fields of
literature, and students learning about new domains are all faced with the
challenge of capturing information they find for later use. However, saving
information is challenging on mobile devices, where the small screen and font
sizes combined with the inaccuracy of finger based touch screens makes it time
consuming and stressful for people to select and save text for future use.
Furthermore, beyond the challenge of simply selecting a region of bounded text
on a mobile device, in many learning and data exploration tasks the boundaries
of what text may be relevant and useful later are themselves uncertain for the
user. In contrast to previous approaches which focused on speeding up the
selection process by making the identification of hard boundaries faster, we
introduce the idea of intentionally supporting uncertain input in the context
of saving information during complex reading and information exploration. We
embody this idea in a system that uses force touch and fuzzy bounding boxes
along with posthoc expandable context to support identifying and saving
information in an intentionally uncertain way on mobile devices. In a two part
user study we find that this approach reduced selection time and was preferred
by participants over the default system text selection method.</p>

<br/>
Answering complex questions such as "How do I grow better tomatoes?" often
requires individuals to conduct extensive online research and synthesis. Can we
crowdsource this complex, high context process with 100 crowdworkers conducting
microtasks distributedly? The Knowledge Accelerator uses crowdworkers to
extract and synthesize text clips across web pages into coherent articles
without a centralized coordinator.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Crowdsourcing  offers  a  powerful  new  paradigm  for  onlinework.   However,
real  world  tasks  are  often  interdependent,requiring a big picture view of
the difference pieces involved. Existing  crowdsourcing  approaches  that
support  such  tasks -- ranging from Wikipedia to flash teams -- are
bottleneckedby relying on a small number of individuals to maintain thebig
picture.   In this paper,  we explore the idea that a computational system can
scaffold an emerging interdependent,big picture view entirely through the small
contributions ofindividuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole.
Toinvestigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we
instantiate the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing  distributed
information  synthesis  and  evaluateits output across a variety of topics.  We
also contribute a setof design patterns that may be informative for other
systemsaimed at supporting big picture thinking in small pieces.</p>
