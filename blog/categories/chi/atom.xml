<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The nature of people’s online activities has gone through dramatic changes in
past decades as significant portions of our productivity and sensemaking tasks
continue to migrate to “the cloud,” yet browser interfaces have stayed
largely the same since tabs were introduced nearly 20 years ago. The divide
between browser interfaces that only provide affordances for managing
individual tabs and users who manage their attention at the task level can lead
to serious adverse effects -- commonly referred to as “tab overload.” This
paper explores the design of a task-centric tab manager called Tabs.do, which
enables users to import and close their open tabs to manage them as tasks.
Users can structure and prioritize their tasks to better reflect their mental
models and resume progress by reopening tasks into open tabs. To lower the cost
of importing, Tabs.do uses machine learning to make intelligent suggestions for
grouping users’ open tabs into task bundles with high precision by exploiting
behavioral and semantic features. Tabs.do bridges the gap between current
browser designs that treat tabs as stacks of independent webpages and users who
manage their workflow and attention at the tasks level. We conducted a field
deployment study where participants used Tabs.do with their real-life tasks and
tabs in the wild and uncovered insights around the costs, benefits, and
limitations of a task-centric approach to tab management.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Tabs have become integral to browsing the Web yet have changed little since
their introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone
through dramatic changes, with users increasingly moving from navigating to
websites to exploring information across many sources to support online
sensemaking. This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a
diverse set of functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We
interviewed ten information workers asking about their tab management
strategies and walk through each open tab on their work computers four times
over two weeks. We uncovered competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open
(ranging from interaction to emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them
(such as limited attention and resources). We then surveyed 103 participants to
estimate the frequencies of these pressures at scale. Finally, we developed
design implications for future browser interfaces that can better support
managing these pressures</p>

make conducting searches on mobile devices especially difficult where screen
real-estate is limited, and progress can often be interrupted. Rather than
using tabs to manage information, we introduce browsing through scaffolding.
Search result lists serve as mutable workspaces where progress can be suspended

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>People engaged in complex searches such as planning a vacation or understanding
their medical symptoms are often overwhelmed by opening and managing many tabs.
These challenges are exacerbated as search moves to smartphones and mobile
devices where screen real-estate is limited and tasks are frequently suspended,
resumed, and interleaved. Rather than continue to utilize tab-based browsing
for complex search, we introduce a new way of browsing through a scaffolded
interface. The list of search results serves as a mutable workspace, where a
user can track progress on a specific information query. The search query
serves as a gateway into this workspace, accessed through a task-subtask
hierarchy. We instantiate this in the Bento mobile search system and
investigate its effectiveness in three studies. We find converging evidence
that users were able to make progress on their complex searching tasks with
this structure, and find it more organized and easier to revisit.</p>

Crowd-powered chatbots are robust than current pure AI approach, but can be
slower and more expensive at runtime. We attempted to combine the two
approaches for high quality, low latency, and low cost.  We introduce Evorus, a
crowd-powered chatbot that automate itself over time by learning to integrate
AI chatbots, reusing responses, and assess response quality. A 5-month-long
public deployment study shows promising results. You can <a href="http://talkingtothecrowd.org/">try talking to Evorus today</a>.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Crowd-powered conversational assistants have been shown to be more robust than
automated systems, but do so at the cost of higher response latency and
monetary costs.  A promising direction is to combine the two approaches for
high quality, low latency, and low cost solutions.  In this paper, we introduce
Evorus, a crowd-powered conversational assistant built to automate itself over
time by i) allowing new chatbots to be easily integrated to automate more
scenarios, ii) reusing prior crowd answers, and iii) learning to automatically
approve response candidates.  Our 5-month-long deployment with 80 participants
and 281 conversations shows that Evorus can automate itself without
compromising conversation quality.  Crowd-AI architectures have long been
proposed as a way to reduce cost and latency for crowd-powered systems; Evorus
demonstrates how automation can be introduced successfully in a deployed
system. Its architecture allows future researchers to make further innovation
on the underlying automated components in the context of a deployed open domain
dialog system.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Crowdsourcing provides a scalable and efficient way to construct labeled
datasets for training machine learning systems. However, creating comprehensive
label guidelines for crowdworkers is often prohibitive even for seemingly
simple concepts. Incomplete or ambiguous label guidelines can then result in
differing interpretations of concepts and inconsistent labels. Existing
approaches for improving label quality, such as worker screening or detection
of poor work, are ineffective for this problem and can lead to rejection of
honest work and a missed opportunity to capture rich interpretations about
data. We introduce Revolt, a collaborative approach that brings ideas from
expert annotation workflows to crowd-based labeling. Revolt eliminates the
burden of creating detailed label guidelines by harnessing crowd disagreements
to identify ambiguous concepts and create rich structures (groups of
semantically related items) for post-hoc label decisions. Experiments comparing
Revolt to traditional crowdsourced labeling show that Revolt produces high
quality labels without requiring label guidelines in turn for an increase in
monetary cost. This up front cost, however, is mitigated by Revolt's ability to
produce reusable structures that can accommodate a variety of label boundaries
without requiring new data to be collected. Further comparisons of Revolt's
collaborative and non-collaborative variants show that collaboration reaches
higher label accuracy with lower monetary cost.</p>
