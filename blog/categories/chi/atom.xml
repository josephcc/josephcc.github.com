 augmenting inline citations based on their connections to the current user
 based on their reading history, paper library, and publication records.
 During literature review sessions, CiteSee allows users to prioritize their
 exploration to focus first on inline citations most relevant to their recent
 readings. It also highlights inline citations to familiar papers, allowing
 users to keep track of their exploration and better contexturalize the current
 paper. Lab and field studies showed CiteSee can improve better paper discovery
 via inline citations, and allowed participants to have better situational
 awareness when conducting real-world literature reviews.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>When reading a scholarly article, inline citations help researchers
contextualize the current article and discover relevant prior work. However, it
can be challenging to prioritize and make sense of the hundreds of citations
encountered during literature reviews. This paper introduces CiteSee, a paper
reading tool that leverages a user's publishing, reading, and saving activities
to provide personalized visual augmentations and context around citations.
First, CiteSee connects the current paper to familiar contexts by surfacing
known citations a user had cited or opened. Second, CiteSee helps users
prioritize their exploration by highlighting relevant but unknown citations
based on saving and reading history. We conducted a lab study that suggests
CiteSee is significantly more effective for paper discovery than three
baselines. A field deployment study shows CiteSee helps participants keep
track of their explorations and leads to better situational awareness and
increased paper discovery via inline citation when conducting real-world
literature reviews.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientific breakthroughs often rely upon scholars synthesizing many published
work into broad overviews and rich insights to identify gaps in the current
literature.  However, survey articles require significant time and effort to
synthesize and can quickly become outdated. Researchers in fast-paced
disciplines also rely on the related work section to better understand the
background when reading a paper.  While related work sections also summarizes
multiple prior work, they typically provide partial views of the larger
research domain. Relatedly explore how a system in which users can quickly
explore and read related work sections extracted across many papers can help
scholars gain richer and more comprehensive overviews of fast-paced domains.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Scholars who want to research a scientific topic must take time to read,
extract meaning, and identify connections across many papers. As scientific
literature grows, this becomes increasingly challenging. Meanwhile, authors
summarize prior research in papers' related work sections, though this is
scoped to support a single paper. A formative study found that while reading
multiple related work paragraphs helps overview a topic, it is hard to navigate
overlapping and diverging references and research foci.  In this work, we
design a system, Relatedly, that scaffolds exploring and reading multiple
related work paragraphs on a topic, with features including dynamic re-ranking
and highlighting to spotlight unexplored dissimilar information, auto-generated
descriptive paragraph headings, and low-lighting of redundant information. From
a within-subjects user study (n=15), we found that scholars generate more
coherent, insightful, and comprehensive topic outlines using Relatedly compared
to a baseline paper list.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>In order to help scholars understand and follow a research topic, significant
research has been devoted to creating systems that help scholars discover
relevant papers and authors.  Recent approaches have shown the usefulness of
highlighting relevant authors while scholars engage in paper discovery.
However, these systems do not capture and utilize users' evolving knowledge of
authors.  We reflect on the design space and introduce ComLittee, a literature
discovery system that supports author-centric exploration.  In contrast to
paper-centric interaction in prior systems, ComLittee's author-centric
interaction supports curation of research threads from individual authors,
finding new authors and papers with combined signals from a paper recommender
and the curated authors' authorship graphs, and understanding them in the
context of those signals.  In a within-subjects experiment that compares to an
author-highlighting approach, we demonstrate how ComLittee leads to a higher
efficiency, quality, and novelty in author discovery that also improves paper
discovery.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The nature of people’s online activities has gone through dramatic changes in
past decades as significant portions of our productivity and sensemaking tasks
continue to migrate to “the cloud,” yet browser interfaces have stayed
largely the same since tabs were introduced nearly 20 years ago. The divide
between browser interfaces that only provide affordances for managing
individual tabs and users who manage their attention at the task level can lead
to serious adverse effects -- commonly referred to as “tab overload.” This
paper explores the design of a task-centric tab manager called Tabs.do, which
enables users to import and close their open tabs to manage them as tasks.
Users can structure and prioritize their tasks to better reflect their mental
models and resume progress by reopening tasks into open tabs. To lower the cost
of importing, Tabs.do uses machine learning to make intelligent suggestions for
grouping users’ open tabs into task bundles with high precision by exploiting
behavioral and semantic features. Tabs.do bridges the gap between current
browser designs that treat tabs as stacks of independent webpages and users who
manage their workflow and attention at the tasks level. We conducted a field
deployment study where participants used Tabs.do with their real-life tasks and
tabs in the wild and uncovered insights around the costs, benefits, and
limitations of a task-centric approach to tab management.</p>

<p>Tabs have become integral to Web browsing yet have changed little since their
introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone through
dramatic changes and increasingly used to support complex sensemaking tasks.
This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a diverse set of

competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open (ranging from interaction to
emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them (such as limited attention and
resources). We further developed rich design implications for future browser

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Tabs have become integral to browsing the Web yet have changed little since
their introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone
through dramatic changes, with users increasingly moving from navigating to
websites to exploring information across many sources to support online
sensemaking. This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a
diverse set of functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We
interviewed ten information workers asking about their tab management
strategies and walk through each open tab on their work computers four times
over two weeks. We uncovered competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open
(ranging from interaction to emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them
(such as limited attention and resources). We then surveyed 103 participants to
estimate the frequencies of these pressures at scale. Finally, we developed
design implications for future browser interfaces that can better support
managing these pressures</p>
