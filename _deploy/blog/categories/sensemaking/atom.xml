<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The nature of people’s online activities has gone through dramatic changes in
past decades as significant portions of our productivity and sensemaking tasks
continue to migrate to “the cloud,” yet browser interfaces have stayed
largely the same since tabs were introduced nearly 20 years ago. The divide
between browser interfaces that only provide affordances for managing
individual tabs and users who manage their attention at the task level can lead
to serious adverse effects -- commonly referred to as “tab overload.” This
paper explores the design of a task-centric tab manager called Tabs.do, which
enables users to import and close their open tabs to manage them as tasks.
Users can structure and prioritize their tasks to better reflect their mental
models and resume progress by reopening tasks into open tabs. To lower the cost
of importing, Tabs.do uses machine learning to make intelligent suggestions for
grouping users’ open tabs into task bundles with high precision by exploiting
behavioral and semantic features. Tabs.do bridges the gap between current
browser designs that treat tabs as stacks of independent webpages and users who
manage their workflow and attention at the tasks level. We conducted a field
deployment study where participants used Tabs.do with their real-life tasks and
tabs in the wild and uncovered insights around the costs, benefits, and
limitations of a task-centric approach to tab management.</p>

introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone through
dramatic changes and increasingly used to support complex sensemaking tasks.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Tabs have become integral to browsing the Web yet have changed little since
their introduction nearly 20 years ago. In contrast, the internet has gone
through dramatic changes, with users increasingly moving from navigating to
websites to exploring information across many sources to support online
sensemaking. This paper investigates how tabs today are overloaded with a
diverse set of functionalities and issues users face when managing them. We
interviewed ten information workers asking about their tab management
strategies and walk through each open tab on their work computers four times
over two weeks. We uncovered competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open
(ranging from interaction to emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them
(such as limited attention and resources). We then surveyed 103 participants to
estimate the frequencies of these pressures at scale. Finally, we developed
design implications for future browser interfaces that can better support
managing these pressures</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Consumers can choose from many different products and base their decisions on
the tens of thousands of online evidence about each of their options.  However,
to synthesize this information into confident decisions can incur high
interaction and cognitive costs. Online information is scattered across
different sources, and evidence such as reviews can be subjective and
conflicting, requiring users to interpret them under their personal context. We
introduce Mesh, which scaffolds users in iteratively building up a better
understanding of both their choices by evaluating evidence gathered across

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>While there is an enormous amount of information online for making decisions
such as choosing a product, restaurant, or school, it can be costly for users
to synthesize that information into confident decisions. Information for users'
many different criteria needs to be gathered from many different sources into a
structure where they can be compared and contrasted. The usefulness of each
criterion for differentiating potential options can be opaque to users, and
evidence such as reviews may be subjective and conflicting, requiring users to
interpret each under their personal context. We introduce Mesh, which
scaffolds users in iteratively building up a better understanding of both their
criteria and options by evaluating evidence gathered across sources in the
context of consumer decision making. Mesh bridges the gap between decision
support systems that typically have rigid structures and the fluid and dynamic
process of exploratory search, changing the cost structure to provide
increasing payoffs with greater user investment. Our lab and field deployment
studies found evidence that Mesh significantly reduces the costs of
gathering and evaluating evidence and scaffolds decision-making through
personalized criteria enabling users to gain deeper insights from data.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Whether figuring out where to eat in an unfamiliar city or deciding which
apartment to live in, consumer generated data (i.e. reviews and forum posts)
are often an important influence in online decision making. To make sense of
these rich repositories of diverse opinions, searchers need to sift through a
large number of reviews to characterize each item based on aspects that they
care about. We introduce a novel system, SearchLens, where searchers build up a
collection of "Lenses" that reflect their different latent interests, and
compose the Lenses to find relevant items across different contexts. Based on
the Lenses, SearchLens generates personalized interfaces with visual
explanations that promotes transparency and enables deeper exploration. While
prior work found searchers may not wish to put in effort specifying their goals
without immediate and sufficient benefits, results from a controlled lab study
suggest that our approach incentivized participants to express their interests
more richly than in a baseline condition, and a field study showed that
participants found benefits in SearchLens while conducting their own tasks.</p>

can be prohibitively difficult for researchers to find useful analogies from
unfamiliar domains as search engines poorly support it. We introduce Solvent, a

into different aspects and use a semantic model to find analogies among
research papers and across different domains. These results demonstrate a new

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant
domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant
ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. To
provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we
introduce Solvent, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of
research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being
addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how
they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a
computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations
that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. We demonstrate
that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval
approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and
that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. These results
demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in
research communities.</p>
