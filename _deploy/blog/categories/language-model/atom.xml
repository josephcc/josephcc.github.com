    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've recently wrote a program for solving sentence-based hangman game automatically. Here's a post
explaining my approach using the British National Corpus, <a href="http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/">srilm</a>
language model and hidden Markov model.</p>

<h2>The Hangman Game</h2>

<p>Last week, my friend <a href="http://itszero.github.com">Zero Cho</a> was asked to write a program that solves the
game of hangman automatically. The rules are
simple: the questions are short sentences or phrases with their characters
concealed, i.e. replaced with an underscore, while spaces and punctuations are revealed. The solving
process is an interactive process in which the solver program will guess a letter, and the question
system will reveal its locations. If you guessed 3 letters that are not in the sentence,
you fail the question.</p>

<p>For example, the initial hint for the answer <code>it's a sunny day</code> is <code>__'_ _ _____ ___</code>,
if a solver program guesses <code>y</code>, the system will respond with <code>__'_ _ ____y __y</code>.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>My friend Zero used a statistical approach that first guesses vows with highest frequencies until the first correct
guess. With one vow revealed, he then repeatedly choose the word with the most portion revealed to
continue guessing. His approach to guessing a half-revealed word is also statistical, namely to find the
most frequent English word that matches the pattern.  His method is explained
in detail in his recent <a href="http://itszero.github.com/blog/2012/10/29/my-way-to-write-a-hangman-ai/">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>The shortcoming of this approach is that it lacks consideration for correlations between words in the
sentences. For example, even the word <code>sorry</code> has a higher frequency than <code>sunny</code>, the latter is more
likely to appear before the word <code>day</code>. In my attempt, I trained a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">Language Model</a> to capture such correlations, and use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">hidden Markov model</a> to guess every word in the sentence
simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Language Model</h2>

<p>I use the state-of-the-art <a href="http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/">srilm</a> package to train my
language model on a portion of the British National Corpus (BNC). For those who are familiar with srilm,
the parameters I've used include order-5, Kneser-Ney discount, and interpolation. I use SWIG to
integrate srilm (in C) with my main program written in Python.</p>

<p>A language model is a statistical model that defines the probability of a sequence of words using
probability distribution trained on a free text corpus.</p>

<p>For example, given a sequence of words $w_1, w_2, w_3, ..., w_n$, the unigram (one-word) language model
calculates the probability of such sequence as
$$P(w<em>{1}w</em>{2}w<em>{3}...w</em>{n}) := P(w_1) * P(w_2) * P(w_3) * ... * P(w_n)$$
this is sometimes called an order-1 language model. The word probability can be calculated by counting
its appearances in the corpus:
$$ P(w) := \frac { count(w) } { |\ corpus\ | } $$
An order-2 language model, or bigram language model, defines the sequence probability using conditional
probability:
$$P(w<em>{1}w</em>{2}w<em>{3}...w</em>{n}) := P(w_1) * P(w_2|w_1) * P(w_3|w_2) * ... * P(w_n|w<em>{n-1})$$
intuitively, conditional probability can be calculated as:
$$ P(w_a|w_b) := \frac { count(w</em>{b}w_{a}) } { count(w_b) } $$
Generally, higher order produces better results but also suffers more severely on the out-of-vocabulary problem
and therefore sometimes needs to fall back to lower order conditional probabilities. Many theories have been
proposed to improve the performance of language models, including absolute discount estimation, good turing,
Kneser-Ney smoothing. Formal definition of language model can be found on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h2>Hidden Markov Model</h2>

<p>Hidden Markov model is a statistical model that solves a sequence of hidden states given a sequence of
observations, state transition probability distribution, and emission probability distribution. For
example, in speech recognition, the recorded audio speech is the observation, the actual text are the
hidden states. Another example is the optical character recognition (OCR) where the scanned images are
the observations. Emission probability distribution indicates the probability from state to observation,
i.e., from text to audio or image. Language model is commonly used for state transition probability
distribution.</p>

<p>In the case solving the Hangman game, the hidden states are the English words in the answer sentences, e.g., <code>it's</code>, <code>a</code>,
<code>sunny</code>, <code>day</code>, and the observations are some half-revealed sequences, e.g., <code>__'s</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>s_nny</code>, <code>__y</code>.
The state transition probability is calculated by the trained language model, e.g., $P(day | sunny)$ in
a order-1 language model. I define the emission probability as the normalize probability of all the
English words that matches the half-revealed pattern, e.g., normalized $P(day), P(pay), P(bay), P(hey),
P(may), ..., etc$. for state <code>__y</code>, and zero otherwise. With the transition and emission probabilities defined, we
can use the Viterbi dynamic programming algorithm to calculate the optimal state sequence.</p>

<p>Formal definition and more information on HMM can be found on
Wikipedia pages <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">here</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm">here</a>, or in a slide I made when I was TA for a NLP course
<a href="http://hadoop.nlpweb.org/~bizkit/lab3/vtb_example/">here</a> (in Chinese).</p>

<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>It is obvious that to run the hidden Markov model on a fully concealed sequence will yield bad results.
Therefore, at stage one my solver also start by guessing high frequency letters. Instead of
guessing vows only, I also use consonants, hoping that revealing some consonants will help the second
stage. The sorted list begins with <code>e, a, i, s, r, n, t, o</code>, ..., etc. This
process stops until it had made one wrong guesses or have revealed more than four letters.</p>

<p>In the second stage, the trained hidden Markov model will tag the half-revealed words with English word
sequence that yield the highest language model probability and word frequencies. The solver will then
guess the letter that appears in most words. This process repeats until all characters are
revealed, and the number of failed guesses are recorded.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Here are three examples and results. The interactive guessing progress and some internal states are
shown in the three tables below.</p>

<p>This one shows HMM produces different results as more characters are revealed.

<p>This last one really shows the power of language model. With only <code>e</code> revealed, the HMM process was able to guess the correct result.</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<p>For stage one, instead of using just the highest frequency letters, conditional probability can also be
a factor for choosing the next letter. For example, if <code>s</code> is revealed as the second to last character
in some words, <code>t</code> and <code>e</code> may likely to be the last letter of such words.</p>

<p>For the two stages, we can decide to advance from stage 1 to 2 base on different factors instead of
heuristically. These may include the confident of the HMM results, the percentage of letters revealed,
the before mentioned conditional probabilities and more. Global optimization approaches can be used to
find good parameters to determine the timing to start stage two.  Alternatively, we can treat the two
stages as different strategies and use genetic algorithm to apply them alternately.</p>
